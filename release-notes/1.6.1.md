This issue may conflate a number of related problems with ACH/EFT verification. In any case, the overall strategy for 
verification of payments has undergone a significant refactoring so that the iATS Journal data is now being stored 
in a raw form locally in CiviCRM.

More notes available here: https://github.com/iATSPayments/com.iatspayments.civicrm/pull/201

## 2. https://github.com/iATSPayments/com.iatspayments.civicrm/issues/197

Back-end recurring contributions using future start dates have been implemented, and a configuration option is 
provided that enables public forms to use this functionality as well.
