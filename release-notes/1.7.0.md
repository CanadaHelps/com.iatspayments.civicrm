# iATS CiviCRM Extension 1.7.0

Jun 4, 2018

This release is a major update from the 1.6.x versions of the iATS payment extension for CiviCRM.
The major addition is to add compatibility with the FirstAmerican processors.
It also removes a fair amount of old deprecated code (old CiviCRM compatibility code and code for UK direct debit, no longer supported),
and modernizes some of the old boilerplate/civix code.
