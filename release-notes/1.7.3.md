# iATS CiviCRM Extension 1.7.3

Aug 30, 2020

This release is a minor maintenance release for the 1.7 series.
It is recommended for all CiviCRM installs on 5.x and above.

It:
1. Removes old deprecated code and improves error handling.
2. Supports the 1st Payment processor for webform civicrm by converting province and country id values to strings in the doPayment function.
3. Fixes incorrect code for the detection of the iATS payment processor (arises when mixing iATS payment processor with other processors, likely the source of https://github.com/iATSPayments/com.iatspayments.civicrm/issues/303).
4. Fixes failures for self-service updating of credit card credentials.
